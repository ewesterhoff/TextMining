# TextMining #
This is the base repo for the text mining and analysis project for Software Design at Olin College.

##Required Libraries##
This set of code requires a small set of python libraries to be pre-installed on the computer: sys, string, random, requests, bs4, urllib, glob, and os.  These libraries can be easily installed on windows using the 'pip install' command.

##Running the Code##
Run fetch_files.py first to create a folder in your workspace called religious documents, which will contain on the order of 1000 religious text files.  You only need to run this once.  From here, run mining.py to randomly generate text.
